###Background

The data that was used inthis project is from data that was collected from October 2013 to March 2016 by Austin Animal Center. 
The data show the outcomes of animals that are in shelters, all the animals were given an ID during the intake.
The outcomes include: Adoption, Death, Euthanasia, Returned to owner, and Transfers.

Approximately 7.6 million dogs and cats end up in US shelters. Most of these animals are given up by their owners, while other are pickedup or taken from cruelty situations. 2.7 million of these dogs and cats are euthanized int he US each year.
We are going to be usign breed, color, sex, and age to prodect the outcome of each animal.

This data will help us understand the trends in shelters when it comes to the animasl outcomes, which could help help sheelters focus their energy on the specific needs of the animals and help them find their forever homes.

This data was evaluated usint the multi-class logarithmic loss, a set of probabilities were submitted fro every class and the belwo formula was then used. 

logloss=−1N∑i=1N∑j=1Myijlog(pij).

###Programs Used

Python along with the following packages 
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
the following zip files were added as well
train.csv - Training set
test.csv - Test set
sample_submission.csv - Sample submission file 

###Reason for Data Set

This is a class project that is similar to projects being doen by other students in the class. 

###Project Explaination

###Acknowledgements

The dataset is brought to us by Austin Animal Center and the shelter animal statistics were taken from the ASPCA
